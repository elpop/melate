## Install

1. Download file
  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/elpop/melate.git
    ```  

2. Install SQLite:

   The programs use SQLite. This is available for Mac OS and the most popular Linux distros.
   
    for Debian/Ubuntu Linux systems:
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
    ```
    
    Fedora/Red-Hat Linux systems:
    
    ```
    sudo dnf install sqlite sqlite-devel
    ```
    
    Mac OS
    
    SQLite is available by default. 
    
3. Perl Dependencies
    
    [File::Copy](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Copy)
    
    [Text::Diff](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Diff)
    
    [Getopt::Long](https://metacpan.org/pod/Getopt::Long)
    
    [Pod::Usage](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod::Usage)

    [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI)

    [DBD::SQLite](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite)

    [LWP::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent)

    All the Perl Modules are available via [metacpan](https://metacpan.org) or install them via the "cpan" program in your system. Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora have packages for the required perl modules.
    
    for Fedora/Redhat:
    
    ```
    sudo dnf install perl-File-Copy perl-Text-Diff perl-Getopt-Long perl-Pod-Usage perl-DBI perl-DBD-SQLite perl-libwww-perl perl-LWP-Protocol-https
    ```
    
    for Debian/Ubuntu:
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get install libdbi-perl libdbd-sqlite3-perl libtext-diff-perl libwww-perl liblwp-protocol-https-perl
    sudo cpan -i Getopt::Long Pod::Usage
    ```
    
    On Mac OS:

    To compile some Perl modules, you need to install the 
    Xcode Command Line Tools:
 
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    Install with CPAN:
    
    ```
    sudo cpan -i File::Copy Text::Diff Getopt::Long Pod::Usage DBI DBD::SQLite LWP::UserAgent LWP::Protocol::https
    ```
    
4. Put it on your search path
    
    Copy the melate.pl program somewhere in your search path:
    
    ```
    sudo cp melate.pl /usr/local/bin/.
    ```
    
## Initial run

The program create a hidden directory ".melate" in your HOME path.

Into the directory create the sqlite DB called "melate.db" and a results directory for processing the files from the lottery authority.

when you run it for the first time you see the following:

```
    Init DB
    Download results from Pronosticos Deportivos
    Melate
    Revancha
    Revanchita
    Melate Retro
```

     
Now, you can use the program :)

You can update the results database with the -dowload option.

## Crontab to update  results

If you want to auto update the lottery results, edit your crontab and add:

```
0 8 * * 1,3,4,6,0 /usr/local/bin/melate.pl -d
```

This will run at 8 o'clock on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.

The "Melate", "Revancha" and "Revanchita" results are available on Thursday, Saturday and Monday.

"Retro" has results available on  Wednesday and Sunday.

## The Database schema

If you are curious and have some knowledge of SQL, you can use SQLite directly.

The results are storage on a SQLite Database wiht the following data schema:

```
$ sqlite3 ~/.melate/melate.db 
-- Loading resources from /Volumes/Pop-Data/pop/.sqliterc
SQLite version 3.32.3 2020-06-18 14:16:19
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE products (
            id         integer not null,
            name       text not null,
            range      integer not null,
            balls      integer not null,
            additional integer not null,
            url        text not null,
            filename   text not null
        );
CREATE TABLE results (
            id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
            draw       integer NOT NULL,
            date_time  TEXT    NOT NULL,
            r1         integer,
            r2         integer,
            r3         integer,
            r4         integer,
            r5         integer,
            r6         integer,
            r7         integer,
            award      integer,
            FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
        );
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX un_p_id on products(id);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX un_pi_d_results ON results(product_id, draw);
CREATE INDEX in_dt_results on results(date_time);
CREATE INDEX in_draw_results on results(draw);
sqlite> .quit 
```
