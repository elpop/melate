    sudo apt-get install libdbi-perl libdbd-sqlite3-perl libtext-diff-perl libwww-perl liblwp-protocol-https-perl
    sudo cpan -i Getopt::Long Pod::Usage
    ```
    
    On Mac OS you can use CPAN:
    
    ```
    sudo cpan -i File::Copy Text::Diff Getopt::Long Pod::Usage DBI DBD::SQLite LWP::UserAgent LWP::Protocol::https

    ```
    
## Initial run

The program create a hidden directory ".melate" in your HOME path.

Into the directory create the sqlite DB called "melate.db" and a results directory for processing the files from the lottery authority.

when you run it for the first time you see the following:

```
    Init DB
    Download results from Pronosticos Deportivos
    Melate
    Revancha
    Revanchita
    Melate Retro
```

     
Now, you can use the program :)

You can update the results database with the -dowload option.

## Crontab to update  results

If you want to auto update the lottery results, edit your crontab and add:

```
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
0 8 * * 1,3,4,6,0 /usr/local/bin/melate.pl -d
```

This will run at 8 o'clock on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.
